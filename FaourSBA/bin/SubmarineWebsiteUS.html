  				<td>6 torpedo tubes, holding up to 22 torpedoes in salvo.</td>
  				<td>The Barbel-class submarines, the last diesel-electric propelled attack submarines built by the United States Navy, incorporated numerous, radical engineering improvements over previous classes. They were the first production warships built with the teardrop-shape hull first tested on the experimental USS Albacore, and the first to combine the control room, attack center, and conning tower in the same space in the hull. They were of double hull design with 1.5-inch thick HY80 steel. This class of submarine became part of the United States Navys fleet in 1959 and was taken out of service in 1990, leaving the Navy with an entirely nuclear-powered submarine fleet.
The Barbel class design is considered to be very effective. The Zwaardvis-class submarines of the Netherlands and the Hai Lung class of the Republic of China (designed and built in the Netherlands) were closely derived from the Barbel class design. The Japanese Uzushio class and its successors were also influenced by the Barbel class.</td>

  				<td>The Skipjack class was a class of United States Navy nuclear submarines (SSNs) that entered service in 1959-61. This class was named after its lead boat, USS Skipjack. The new class introduced the teardrop hull and the S5W reactor to U.S. nuclear submarines. The Skipjacks were the fastest U.S. nuclear submarines until the Los Angeles-class submarines, the first of which entered service in 1974.</td>

  				<td>The Permit-class submarine (known as the Thresher class until the lead boat USS Thresher was lost) was a class of nuclear-powered fast attack submarines (hull classification symbol SSN) in service with the United States Navy from the early 1960s until 1996. They were a significant improvement on the Skipjack-class, with greatly improved sonar, diving depth, and silencing. They were the forerunners of all subsequent US Navy SSN designs. They served from the 1960s through to the early 1990s, when they were decommissioned due to age. They were followed by the Sturgeon and Los Angeles classes. Originally known as the Thresher-class submarine, the name of the class was changed following the mysterious sinking of the USS Thresher on April 10th, 1963 off the coast of Cape Cod, MA.</td>

  				<td>The Sturgeon class (known colloquially in naval circles as the 637 class) was a class of nuclear-powered fast attack submarines (SSN) in service with the United States Navy from the 1960s until 2004. They were the "workhorses" of the Navys attack submarine fleet throughout much of the Cold War. The boats were phased out in the 1990s and early 21st century, as their successors, the Los Angeles, followed by the Seawolf and Virginia-class boats, entered service.</td>

  				<td>USS Narwhal (SSN-671), a unique submarine, was the third vessel of the United States Navy to be named for the narwhal, a gray and white arctic whale with a unicorn-like, ivory tusk. The sole Narwhal-class had her keel laid down on 17 January 1966 by the Electric Boat Division of General Dynamics Corporation, in Groton, Connecticut. She was launched on 9 September 1967 sponsored by Vice admiral Glynn R. Donaho (ret.), and commissioned on 12 July 1969.</td>

  				<td>The Los Angeles-class of submarines are nuclear-powered fast attack submarines (SSN) in service with the United States Navy. Also known as the 688 class (pronounced "six-eighty-eight") after the hull number of lead vessel USS Los Angeles (SSN-688), 62 were built from 1972 to 1996, the latter 23 to an improved 688i standard. As of 2022, 26 of the Los Angeles class remain in commission — more than any other class in the world — and they account for more than half of the U.S. Navys 50 fast attack submarines. Of the 34 retired boats, a few were in commission for nearly 40 years, including USS Dallas, USS Jacksonville and USS Bremerton. With a wide variance in longevity, 12 of the 688s were laid up halfway through their projected lifespans, USS Baltimore being the youngest-retired at 15 years, 11 months. Another five also laid up early (20–25 years), due to their midlife reactor refueling being cancelled, and one was lost during overhaul due to arson. All retired boats have been or will be scrapped per the Navys Ship-Submarine Recycling Program.</td>

  				<td>Seawolf-class</td>
  				<td>8 torpedo tubes with up to 50 weapons in reserve. The Seawolf-class submarine uses the Mk48 torpedo, as well as the TLAM and UGM-84 Harpoon missiles.</td>
  				<td>The Seawolf-class is a class of nuclear-powered, fast attack submarines (SSN) in service with the United States Navy. The class was the intended successor to the Los Angeles-class, and design work began in 1983. A fleet of 29 submarines was to be built over a ten-year period, but that was reduced to 12 submarines. The end of the Cold War and budget constraints led to the cancellation of any further additions to the fleet in 1995, leaving the Seawolf-class limited to just three boats. This, in turn, led to the design of the smaller Virginia-class. The Seawolf-class cost about $3 billion per unit ($3.5 billion for USS Jimmy Carter), making it the most expensive United States Navy fast attack submarine and second most expensive submarine ever, after the French Triomphant-class nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines.</td>

  				<td>The George Washington-class was a class of nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines deployed by the United States Navy. George Washington, along with the later Ethan Allen, Lafayette, James Madison, and Benjamin Franklin classes, comprised the "41 for Freedom" group of submarines that represented the Navys main contribution to the nuclear deterrent force through the late 1980s.</td>

  				<td>Ohio-class</td>
  				<td>4 torpedo tubes, with up to 20 Trident I C4 Submarine Launched Ballistic Missiles, or up to 24 Trident II D5 Submarine Launched Ballistic Missiles.</td>
  				<td>The Ohio-class of nuclear-powered submarines includes the United States Navys 14 ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) and its four cruise missile submarines (SSGNs). Each displacing 18,750 tons submerged, the Ohio-class boats are the largest submarines ever built for the U.S. Navy. They are the worlds third-largest submarines, behind the Russian Navys Soviet-designed 48,000-ton Typhoon-class and 24,000-ton Borei-class. At 24 Trident II missiles apiece, Ohio-class boats carry more missiles than either the Borei-class (16, 20 by the Borei II) or the Typhoon-class. Like its predecessor Benjamin Franklin- and Lafayette-class subs, the Ohio-class SSBNs are part of the United States nuclear-deterrent triad, along with U.S. Air Force strategic bombers and intercontinental ballistic missiles. The 14 SSBNs together carry about half of U.S. active strategic thermonuclear warheads. Although the Trident missiles have no preset targets when the submarines go on patrol, they can be given targets quickly, from the United States Strategic Command based in Nebraska, using secure and constant radio communications links, including very low frequency systems.</td>
