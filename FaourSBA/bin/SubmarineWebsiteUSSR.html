  				<td>The Kilo class, Soviet designation Project 877 Paltus, NATO reporting name Kilo, is a class of diesel-electric attack submarines originally designed in the 1970s and built in the Soviet Union for the Soviet Navy. The initial version of Kilo submarines entered operational service in 1980 and were built until the mid-1990s. Production was switched to the more advanced Project 636 Varshavyanka variant in the mid-1990s, also known as Improved Kilo class in the West. The class was updated again by the Rubin Design Bureau in the mid-2010s and called the Project 636.3</td>

  				<td>The Alfa class, Soviet designation Project 705 Lira, NATO reporting name Alfa, was a class of nuclear-powered attack submarines in service with the Soviet Navy from 1971 into the early 1990s, with one serving later with the Russian Navy until 1996. They were the fastest military submarines ever built, with only the prototype submarine K-222 exceeding them in submerged speed.The Project 705 submarines had a unique design among other submarines. In addition to the revolutionary use of titanium for its hull, it used a powerful lead-bismuth cooled reactor as a power source, which greatly reduced the size of the reactor compared to conventional designs, thus reducing the overall size of the submarine, and allowing for very high speeds. However, it also meant that the reactor had a short lifetime and had to be kept warm when it was not being used. As a result, the submarines were used as interceptors, mostly kept in port ready for a high-speed dash into the North Atlantic.</td>

  				<td>The K-278 Komsomolets was the Project-685 Plavnik, also known by her NATO reporting name of "Mike"-class, nuclear-powered attack submarine of the Soviet Navy; the only submarine of her design class.
				In the inventory of the Soviet military, K-278 was unique for her submarine depth rating, having reached a depth of 1,020 meters (3,350 feet) in the Norwegian Sea on 4 August 1984. Although K-278 was commissioned in the Soviet Navy to evaluate the technology for the fourth-generation of Russian nuclear submarines, she was capable of combat maneuvering and deployment. During her third operational patrol in the Arctic Ocean in 1989, a serious fire in the aft compartments led to her sinking in the Barents Sea off the coast of Norway. Despite the fire in the engineering compartment, K-278 was able to surface and remained afloat for approximately five hours before sinking. Many of the crew perished before rescue, leading to 42 total dead.</td>

  				<td>The Akula class, Soviet designation Project 971 Shchuka-B, NATO reporting name Akula are a series of fourth generation nuclear-powered attack submarines (SSNs) first deployed by the Soviet Navy in 1986. The Russians call all of the submarines Shchuka-B, regardless of modifications. Some confusion may exist as the name Akula was used by the Soviets for a different class of submarines, the Project 941, which is known in the West as the Typhoon class. The Project 971 was named Shchuka-B by the Soviets but given the designation Akula by the West after the name of the lead ship, K-284. According to defense analyst Norman Polmar, the launch of the first submarine in 1985, "shook everyone [in the West] up", as Western intelligence agencies had not expected the Soviet Union to produce such a boat for another ten years.</td>

  				<td>The Typhoon class, Soviet designation Project 941 Akula, NATO reporting name Typhoon, is a class of nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines designed and built by the Soviet Union for the Soviet Navy. With a submerged displacement of 48,000 tonnes, the Typhoons are the largest submarines ever built, able to accommodate comfortable living facilities for the crew of 160 when submerged for months on end. The source of the NATO reporting name remains unclear, although it is often claimed to be related to the use of the word "typhoon" by General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev of the Communist Party in a 1974 speech while describing a new type of nuclear ballistic missile submarine, as a reaction to the United States Navy's new Ohio-class submarine.</td>
